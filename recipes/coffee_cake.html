            <li>Whisk flour, sea salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine walnuts, brown sugar, white sugar, salt, cinnamon, and melted butter in a bowl. 
                Mix until walnuts and sugar are thoroughly coated with butter.</li>
            <li>Cream butter and sugar together in another bowl with a spatula until well blended. 
                Add 1 egg and whisk until mixture is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Whisk in second egg until thoroughly incorporated. Add vanilla extract and yogurt; whisk together. 
                Add flour mixture to wet ingredients; whisk just until flour disappears. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Remove cores from apples. Cut across into <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> -to 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> -inch slices. 
                Stack up a few slices, make 1 cut down the center, and dice across into cubes. 
                Add to cake batter, folding in with a spatula until just combined.</li>
            <li>Spread <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> of the batter evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
                Scatter <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> of the crumble mixture evenly over the top. 
                Top with the rest of the batter in dollops. Spread carefully to evenly distribute, trying not to disturb the crumbs.

            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a toothpick or bamboo skewer inserted into the center comes out clean,
