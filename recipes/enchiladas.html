        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef with onion in a skillet over 
                medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 
                about 10 minutes. Drain grease. Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, 
                sour cream, parsley, taco seasoning, oregano, and black pepper 
                into the ground beef until cheese has melted.  
                Mix in enchilada sauce, chili powder, garlic, and salt; 
                bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and simmer until 
                meat sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup of meat sauce down the center of the tortilla. 
                Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black beans and a sprinkling of black olives. 
                Roll the tortilla up, enclosing the filling, and lay seam-side down into a 9x13-inch baking dish.  
                Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spoon any remaining meat sauce over the enchiladas 
                and scatter any remaining black beans and black olives over the top. Sprinkle tortillas with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping is melted and enchiladas and sauce are bubbling, 20 to 22 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
