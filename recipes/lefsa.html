            <li>Peel potatoes and place them in a large pot with water.
            Bring water to a boil, and let the potatoes boil until soft. Drain and mash</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 8 cups mashed potatoes, cream, butter, salt, and 
            sugar. Cover potatoes and rerigerate over night.</li>
            <li>Mix flour into the mashed potatoes and roll the mixture into balls about the size 
            tennis balls, or smaller depending on preference. Keep balls of dough on plate in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Taking on ball out of the refrigerator at a time, roll dough balls out on a floured board. 
            To keep the dough from sticking while rolling it out, it helps to have a rolling pin 
            with a cotton rolling pin covers</li>
            <li>Fry the lefsa in a grill or in an iron skillet at very high heat. If lefsa brown too much, 
            turn the heat down. After cooking each piece of lefsa place on a dishtowel. Fold towel over 
            lefsa to keep warm. Stack lefsa on top of each other and keep covered to keep from drying out.</li>
