Oden Recipe Webpage Practice

Practice to learn the basics of HTML learned currently from the Odin 
Project. Used unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, images, and relative links. Will come back to this later in the Odin Project to update webpage 
look using CSS, and likely again to apply Javascript to add functionality.
